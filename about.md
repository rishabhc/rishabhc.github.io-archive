I am a student of Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication. 

You will find me either developing web applications or fighting for equal human rights whenever I am not busy with my academics. I am a member of the software development section of, [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/) and an editor of the official technical magazine, [Geek Gazette](http://gg.ieeeiitr.com/) of my college. Apart from hearing the words 'oppresive society' and 'I want pizza' from me at random instances of time, you can see me either spending my time on [Github](https://github.com/rishabhc) or [Tumblr](http://rishabhc.tumblr.com/). 

I am also a web security enthusiast and from this moment on a blogger maybe?
